# Predicting house price using regression
The project is implemented using linear regression algorithm. Here I have built three models   
One based on 'sqft_living' feature  
One based on some more features like ['bedrooms','bathrooms','sqft_living','sqft_lot','floors','zipcode']  
One based on some advanced features like ['bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'sqft_living', 'sqft_lot', 'floors', 'zipcode','condition', 'grade','waterfront', 'view','sqft_above',
'sqft_basement','yr_built', 'yr_renovated', 'lat', 'long','sqft_living15', 'sqft_lot15', ] 
# Requirements
Graphlab Create  
Anaconda2  
IPython Notebook
#
Download the home_data.sframe dataset file.
# Analysis of the different models
It can be seen that the house price of the same house for differ in all the three models.
